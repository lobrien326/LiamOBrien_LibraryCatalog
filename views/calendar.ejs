            <p>This is another placeholder page. Ideally I will have some sort of calendar which can load event data from the backend, but I won't be sure how I want to implement it until I start working on that. If that plan doesn't work out,
                I will just have a static calendar of events for a single month here, populated with some basic stuff. It'll probably just be a very big html table.
