There isn't much for a README file yet. First of all, I added you as a collaborator because I wasn't sure how else to give you access to the repo without just making it public and sending you a link. I've only done the most core elements of front-end development because a lot of my website will revolve around exactly how I integrate the back-end. If I over-plan now, I'll just end up having to change stuff later. I left a few notes on each page that basically explain what the page will eventually do, when I fully implement it.
